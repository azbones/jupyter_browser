    "## What is a variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "All programming languages use variables to keep track of what they are doing. Variables as their name implies can vary or change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to write a program that tells the temperature of the room you are in. Your program connects to a sensor which when asked will return the current temperature. While the actual temperature of the room will change, your program needs something to refer to that has the current temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where variables come in. A variable is a name for a value like temperature. When writing a program you can name the variable almost anything you want. You should give it a name that represents what it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you can create a variable called ```temperature```. Once you create that variable, you can change it or use it to do other things.  Let's try this for real using Python in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The text in the code block below is creating a variable called ```temperature``` and assigning it an initial value of 70. In order to create the variable in Python, we have to run the code. We can do that by putting our cursor in the code block below and clicking the \"run\" button in the menu above. We can also run code by selecting the code block with our cursor and hitting ```control-return```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start running code, we should talk about code comments. In a code block, we can include text that we want as a note to humans that Python ignores and does not run. We call these comments. To make a comment in Python, we add a ```#``` before the text we want to ignore. So, when you see comments, they will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a comment. Python does not read comments when code is run.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers use comments to help them understand code. We will use comments to help you understand what to do in the code block."

By access it, we mean making sure it was created and saved in the Python programming language environment. We can do that in a number of ways. The easiest way is to just enter the variable name in our Python and run it with Python. Do that in the code block below by entering the variable name and running the code block."
