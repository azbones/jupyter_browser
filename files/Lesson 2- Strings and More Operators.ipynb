    "## Different types of values\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last lesson, we assigned some values to the variables we created. Recall, we made a variable called ```temperature``` to which we then assigned a value of 70. We did this like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "temperature = 70\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature is our variable name, the equal sign is the way Python knows what to assign to the variable, and 70 is the value we assigned. If we wanted to convert out Python code into an English phrase it would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```create a variable called temperature and then assign the number 70 to it```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to assign many different types of things to variables. In the temperature case, we assigned a *numeric* value of 70 to the temperature variable. The data type of a something to be assigned to a variable describes what kind of thing it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "For numeric data types, there are three basic kinds. The value ```70``` we used above is an integer (it is a whole number). When we assigned 70 to the variable ```temperature```, Python automatically decided it was an integer given it had no decimal places. \n",
    "\n",
    "|Category|Data Types|Example|\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "|numeric|```int```|an integer like 4|\n",
    "|numeric|```float```|a floating point number like 4.12|\n",
    "|numeric|```complex```|a complex or imaginary number like 3+5i|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the ```type()``` command to determine what data type a value or variable has. Much like the ```print``` command we used in the last lesson, we use ```type``` by putting the value or variable we want to determine the data type for in the parentheses of the command. Instead of printing the variable value, ```type``` returns the data type using Python's names for different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do that now.\n"
